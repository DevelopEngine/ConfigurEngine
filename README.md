# ConfigurEngine

## Part of **DevelopEngine**

The ConfigurEngine package provides a handful of simple extension methods to improve ASP.NET Core's default configuration infrastructure.

You don't have to be using ASP.NET Core for this package, as it will work anywhere `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` is supported.
